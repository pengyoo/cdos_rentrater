### RentRater

Due to the housing crisis in Ireland, it is very difficult for people to find suitable accommodation nationwide in recent years. And the rental market is becoming more and more dominated by ‘sellers’, some dishonest landlords cover
up potential problems of their properties, making it difficult to protect tenants’ rights.

In order to solve this problem, I developed a rent review web application, RentRater, allowing tenants to rate and review rental properties (rooms). RentRater also aims to foster a community of responsible tenants and landlords.
RentRater is developed in Python and the Django framework.

With the help of AWS and its related cloud services, I am trying to implement it in a cloud-native approach. I use Cloud9 as the development environment, S3 as a cloud object storage service, and Elastic Beanstalk as the deployment environment. Ultimately,
through the combination of Code Pipeline, Code Build, Github, and the other services and tools previously mentioned to automate the continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) process. I also use Pylint as a static analysis tool, and SonarCloud as a static application security testing tool, and integrate them into the CI/CD pipeline, to implement a seamless software development lifecycle and ensure code quality.

Finally, I implemented a straightforward house rent rating and review application, automated the CI/CD process through the use of fully managed AWS cloud services, conducted static analysis and static application security analysis over the source code,
significantly improved the development and operation efficiency, and realized the security of software.
